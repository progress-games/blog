During travel a common thought is the willingness to do more travel. You will never reach every destination. This is described as the 'travel bug' and it refers to the urge to explore the world that is only obtained after some travel - people who have yet to leave their home country seldom feel this. I do not think I have contracted the travel bug; however, I believe that feeling of recieving a taste of freedom and wishing for more is widely applicable. 

When I released bugTDX and made some money, that is when I got the 'gamedev bug'. I had an incredibly slim taste of what life could be and I immediately wanted to fix all my mistakes and do it again. I wanted to do better. After fishTDX I feel the same urge. There were so many things that I could have done better and I am realising this is likely best amended not by another release, but by multiple more releases. I need to make game after game after game until I get the formula just right. The magic of gamedev is that it can be done anywhere, independently, making it incredibly attractive for me to be pursued as a career. In my ideal world, I will release a game every so often and make $50k or more. But how do I get there?

I had a long rant planned out but I am at an airport and I have a flight to catch. Until next time.
